\begin{acknowledgments} 
I would like to express the deepest appreciation to my committee chair, Dr. Nicholas Flann. Without his guidance and persistent help this dissertation would not have been possible.

I would like to thank all my committee members for their continued support. In addition, thanks to my co-author Anna Doloman who helped in making this work biologically realistic.
