\begin{abstract}
% A space is needed before the text starts so that the first paragraph
% is indented properly.

This is the abstract of the demonstration thesis.  Hopefully the
examples will be sufficiently clear that you will have few formatting
problems. The Graduate School requires that the abstract be 350 words
or less, so be careful of the length of the abstract.
