%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Image compression or image coding is the process of reducing the
redundancy in the image data that may result in some loss of
information.  Vector quantization (VQ)\footnote{The acronym VQ is used
  as an abbreviation for both vector quantization and vector
  quantizer.} is one such technique.

\section{Background}
Binary splitting is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:split}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{samplefig}
\caption{Binary splitting.}
\label{fig:split}
\end{figure}
This figure is generated using an open-source figure drawing package
(called {\tt fig}).  Any figure drawing package can be used to
generate figures.  The easiest format for output is to output the
figures in {\tt .pdf} format for inclusion in the {\tt .tex} file.

% For the following three examples, note the problems with the xdvi
% viewer described in the thesis.tex and the README.txt files.

% TikZ example:  This is the same as the above figure, except done
% using TikZ.

There are many other ways to create figures.  One package compatible
with \LaTeX\ is TikZ.  An example is given in
Fig.~\ref{fig:split_tikz}. This is identical to Fig.~\ref{fig:split},
except that it is done within the compiling process of \LaTeX.
Another example of a third-party figure package is given in
Fig.~\ref{fig:circuitikz_exmple}.  This circuit was generated using
the {\tt circuitikz} package.

It is important that there is no text between figures when they are
referenced close together in the text.  They should be ``stacked''
without text in between as seen above.

A final way of creating graphs is to use a open-sourse package called
{\tt PGFPlots}.  An example of a good-looking graph generated using
this package is given in Fig~\ref{fig:pgfplots_example}.  Note that
this figure is large enough that it is pushed by \LaTeX\ to another
page by itself and nicely centered.
